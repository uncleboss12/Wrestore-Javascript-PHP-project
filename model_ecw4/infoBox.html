<h2><b>What do these numbers mean? </b></h2>
<p>The list below provides  information on the characteristics of the sub-basin selected and details on the  various conservation practices proposed for the sub-basin.</p>
<p>The various attributes of  conservation practices are explained in the following manner in the list:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Strip cropping:</b> This is implemented only on the agricultural areas of the sub-basin. &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; indicates
        that strip cropping is proposed and implemented in the selected  sub-basin&rsquo;s fields.</li>
    <li><b>Crop  rotation:</b> This is implemented only on the agricultural areas of the sub-basin.
        &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;
        indicates that crop rotation is proposed and implemented in the selected  sub-basin&rsquo;s fields.</li>
    <li><b>Cover  crop:</b> This is implemented only on the agricultural areas of the sub-basin.  &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;
        indicates that cover crop is proposed and implemented in the selected  sub-basin&rsquo;s fields.</li>
    <li><b>Filter  strip width:</b> This indicates the width of filter strips proposed in this  selected
        sub-basin. Width
        units are in feet.</li>
    <li><b>Grassed  waterways:</b> These are proposed only in first order streams. &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; indicates
        that  the grassed
        waterways are proposed and implemented in the selected sub-basin&rsquo;s  streams.</li>
    <li><b>Conservation tillage:</b> This includes the &ldquo;no-till&rdquo; practice implemented  only on the agricultural
        areas of the
        sub-basin. &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; indicates that no-till  is proposed and implemented in the selected sub-basin&rsquo;s fields</li>
    <li><b>Wetlands  area:</b> This is the total area of all the new accumulated wetlands proposed and
        implemented in this
        sub-basin. Area units are in acres.</li>
    <li><b>Wetlands drainage area fraction:</b> This is the fraction of the sub-basin area that drains  into the
        new accumulated wetlands in this
        sub-basin.</li>
</ol>
